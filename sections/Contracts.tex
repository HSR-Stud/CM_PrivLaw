\begin{compactitem}

	\item For how long
	\item For how much
\end{compactitem}

\begin{compactitem}
	\item Freedom of contract: freedom to chose a contracting party and the content / the conditions
	\item Offer and acceptance
	\item Two or more parties
	\item Mutual consent over «essentialia negotii» (essential terms)
	\item As a rule: No written form!
\end{compactitem}

\begin{compactitem}
	\item Legal impact: only in relation to the contracting party
	\item Contract creates rights and obligations between the parties
	\item Any change to the contract must be mutually agreed
	\item Enforcement only against the contracting party
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Freedom of contract}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Freedom to conclude or not conclude a contract, freedom to terminate:} No one is obliged to conclude a contract. Exemptions: A legal provision to conclude a contract is the obligation of every car owner to effect an insurance.
	\item \textbf{Freedom to choose the contractual partner:} Everyone has the right to choose his/her contractual partner. Exceptions: minors cannot validly conclude certain (majority!) contracts.
	\item \textbf{Freedom to establish the contracts content:} If the content is forbidden by law the contract is null and void. Swiss law, in particular the Swiss Code of Obligations, contains few mandatory provisions that need to be taken into account.
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Form}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item As a rule: No written form!
	\item A contract may be concluded orally or even without using words but by a consenting behavior (tacit)
	\item Written form is prescribed only if one or both parties require(s) protection (examples: apprenticeship contract, inheritance contracts, real estate contracts)
	\item Most parties choose the written form voluntarily in order to have clarity and	proof
	\item What is written form? -> personal signature (Art. 13 ff. of OR)
	\item Digital signature does not meet this requirement, it merely authenticates the	individual!
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Swiss code of obligations}
\textbf{General provisions on conclusion of contracts performance and non-performance:}
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Conclusion of the contract ( How to reach consent: mutual expression of intent)
	\item Form of contracts
	\item Defects in consent: error, fraud, duress
	\item Representation: authorization to act on someone else’s behalf
	\item Performance of obligations ( place, time, payment )
	\item Breach of contract: the consequences of non-performance of obligations
	\item Third parties
	\item Time limits
	\item Special types of contracts
\end{compactenum}

\subsection{General terms and conditions}
General Terms and Conditions are predefined contracts a provider/seller concludes with its customers. \\
\textbf{Aim of General Terms and Conditions:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Gain efficiency
	\item Allocate risk («NO WARRANTIES NO LIABILITIES»)
	\item Terms and Conditions for sale in webshops, licenses for software etc. apply once the box is ticked, whether or not you have read them!
\end{compactitem}
\textbf{When do they apply?}\\
General Terms and Conditions of a provider / seller only apply if the customer has accepted them. The provider/seller is obliged to bring the GTCs to the attention of the customer (explicit reference) prior to the conclusion of the individual contract/provision of goods or services. General Terms and Conditions provided after acceptance by customer are not valid and do not apply.\\
\textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Rule of «Unusualness»:} If the General Terms and Conditions contain provisions the consumer could	not have expected, such provisions are interpreted to the disadvantage of the provider/seller.
	\item \textbf{Rule of «Unclarity»:}	If the General Terms and Conditions contain provisions that are unclear to the consumer, such provisions are interpreted to the disadvantage of the provider/seller.
	\item \textbf{Unfair competition:} Pursuant to Art. 8 of the Federal Act against Unfair Competition (UCA), General Terms and Conditions are deemed unfair if, in violation of good faith, they create a considerable and unjustified disparity between the vendor and the customer.
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Framework Agreements}
Framework agreements set the frame for larger projects and contain general terms. The what when how is then determined in detail in Work Orders.
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Assistance and collaboration duties
	\item Contract term
	\item Liability
	\item Costs
	\item Security standards and technical standards
	\item Data protection and confidentiality
	\item Conflict prevention and conflict management

\subsection{The Consequences of Non-Performance of Obligations}
Prerequisites for liability pursuant to art. 97 CO and burden of proof:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item damage (amount)
	\item breach of a contract
	\item causality between the damage and the breach
	\item misconduct attributable to the obligor (assumed)
\end{compactitem}
\textbf{Penalties:}\\
The contractual penalty must be contractually agreed and is due in the event of an infringement of a contractual duty, such as:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Non-performance
	\item Inadequate performance
	\item Delay
	\item Confidentiality
	\item Non-competition clause
	\item Data Protection / Security
\end{compactitem}
Contractual penalties are due even if the other contracting party has not incurred a damage. If a damage has occurred, damages are to be paid if the damages exceed the amount of the contractual penalty. The parties may agree in the contract that contractual penalties are due in addition to damages. If the amount of the contractual penalty is extremely high, a court may reduce them.
