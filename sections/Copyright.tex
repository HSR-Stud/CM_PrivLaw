\section{Patent, design, copyright and trademark}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/patent_copyright_and_trademark}
Protection is limited to the form expressing an idea. Ideas as such or a mere concept are not protected. Ideas need to flow freely!

\subsection{Copyright}
\subsubsection{Purpose of copyright law}
Through their works and performances, creative artists contribute to our country's cultural diversity . However they also want to earn something with their works and performances.
\begin{compactitem}
	\item The copyright law guarantees them financial remuneration for the utilization of their works. 
	\item The copyright law protects artists intellectual property in that they are able to defend themselves against misappropriation of their work.
	\item Copyright is a tool with which to earn something from cultural creativity. It is thus a part of our liberal economic and social order which safeguards property (including intellectual property). 
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Definition of a "work"}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Texts
	\item Music
	\item Photography
	\item Works of fine art
	\item Works with scientific content
	\item Architecture
	\item Visual and audiovisual works
	\item Choreographies and pantomimes
	\item Computer programs
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Prerequisites for legal protection of a work}
\textbf{Prerequisites for legal protection:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Intellectual creation
	\item Individual character
	\item Perceptability / expression of an idea
	\item Irrespective of any value or purpose
	\item Work created by humans
\end{compactitem}
\textbf{“Statistical Uniqueness”, abstract criteria:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Characteristic features
	\item No one else would have created the work that way
	\item Sufficiently creative step beyond sheer otherness
	\item Work is something unique and special
\end{compactitem}
\textbf{Individual character:} \\
Analysis of concrete criteria for each category of work, eg photography
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Selection of object, image section and time of triggering
	\item Design of the image components
	\item Distribution of light and shadow
	\item Use of specific lenses or filters
	\item processing of the negative
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Work and work copy}
Work: Intangible good / intellectual property (eg. Firefox)\\
Work copy: materialized work, ie physically existent, often (but not necessarily) physical expression of the work (eg. Firefox installed on a computer)

\subsubsection{Second hand work}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Creation using pre-existing works
	\item Independent protection of these works, if protection requirements fulfilled
	\item Protection of the existing works is reserved
	\item Creative change of a pre-existing work
	\item Individual character and thus independent protection of processing. But: individual character of the existing work still recognizable
	\item Example: Translation, filming, staging
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{What is copyright?}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Author of a copyrighted work is always the natural person who created the work (“creator principle”). Copyright law is an absolute right and thus excludes every other person.
	\item Copyrights can be transferred from the original author to another person/legal entity who then becomes the right holder.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Moral rights}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Recognition of authorship
	\item First publication
	\item Integrity of the work
\end{compactitem}
Moral rights vest in the author and cannot be transferred/licensed.

\subsubsection{Authorship}
\textbf{Joint Authors:} \\
When multiple people work together pursuant to a common concept to create a work together. The joint authors can only decide jointly on what happens with the work. Conclude a contract! \\
\textbf{Copyright and Employment:} 
\begin{compactitem}
	\item General rule: the author is right holder upon creation. The employer is not entitled unless employee transfers the copyrights within individual employment contracts.
	\item Exception: the law assumes that copyright in a computer program vests in the employer if an employee creates the computer program during working hours as part of his or her job.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Duration of copyright}
A work is protected under copyright as soon as it is created . It is not necessary to file for protection or to “deposit” the work. In Switzerland there is no register.\\
\textbf{Not required:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Having the work recorded on a carrier (printed book, pressed CD)
	\item Publication of the work
	\item The explicit will to create work
	\item Ability to act: authors can, for example, also under-assisted or hypnotized persons
\end{compactitem}
\textbf{Formalities:} \\
It is also not necessary to refer to the copyright in the work. Notations such as “copyright“, “all rights reserved“ or “©” have no influence on protection in Switzerland. In other countries the notification can be important for copyright protection. \\
\textbf{Duration:}
In Switzerland copyright protection expires 70 years after the death of the author. Exception: the protection for computer programs ends 50 years after the death of the author.

\subsubsection{Limitations of copyright}
Whoever publishes, reproduces, performs, broadcasts or otherwise disseminates a work requires the author’s consent. However: Private use is not subject to license fees. But that does not apply to computer programs: Permission from the rights holder must be obtained for each use!

\subsubsection{Related rights}
The Copyright Act also regulates related rights (or neighboring rights).
\begin{compactitem}
	\item the rights of performing artists (musicians, actors) to their performances;
	\item the rights of producers of phonograms and videograms to their products (CD, DVD);
	\item the rights of broadcasters to their radio and television broadcasts.
\end{compactitem}
Related rights protection expires 50 years after the performer’s performance, the publication of the phonogram or videogram (or the production of it, in the case that it is not published) or the emission of the broadcast. The rights of a performing artist to be named as performer ends upon his or her death, or 50 years after the performance, at the earliest.

\subsubsection{Legal protection}
\textbf{Civil procedures:} \\
Civil proceedings involve copyright claims between private persons/private legal entities.
The author/right holder can request from the civil court
\begin{compactitem}
	\item a declaratory judgment (have a right established);
	\item have an infringement banned/remedied;
	\item have property confiscated;
	\item have an order published.
\end{compactitem}
\textbf{Criminal procedures:} \\
Criminal procedures may be initiated by the right holder within 3 months after becoming aware of an infringement or the authorities. \\
Fines or imprisonment of up to 1 year (or 5 years if committed on a commercial basis) for use without the right holder’s consent in particular:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item use of a work within correctly indicating the author
	\item publishing a work
	\item change a work
	\item use for derivative work
	\item copies of works
	\item distributing or making works available
	\item broadcasting
	\item renting out of computer programs
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Collecting Societies}
The Federal Copyright Act is based on the view that the rights accruing to authors are essentially the responsibility of the right holders to assert for themselves. The Federal Copyright Act only envisages collective management by collective rights management organizations in circumstances where mass utilization makes direct management virtually impossible.

\subsubsection{Copyright law and Internet}
\textbf{Use of content:} \\
Downloading, copying, scanning, etc., are types of use of a copyrighted work. \\
The right holder has the right to give permission to any kind of use of his work or to revoke this permission. This permission must be given expressly (verbally or in writing) or implied. \\
When published works are used as sources in the Internet, they must be cited in the way books are cited; otherwise plagiarism is taking place. \\
\textbf{Links:} \\
This first of all facilitates access to the linked page (by clicking directly on the link), and secondly implies to the internet user that the linked pages are associated. This assumption can be wrong. Therefore, rights can in fact be infringed simply through linking, such as those contained in the Federal Act against Unfair Competition (UCA) or the Data
Protection Act (DPA). Therefore, linking should always be agreed upon between the parties.

\subsubsection{Federal copyright act}
The Federal Copyright Act of 1992, is the legal basis for the protection of literary works and works of art. It is currently under revision. It also governs what are known as “neighboring rights”, i.e. the rights of performers, record producers and broadcasting companies. The Federal Copyright Act stipulates the rights and obligations of the five
collective administration societies.

\subsection{Trademark}
A trademark is a protected sign which is used to identify a product or service and to distinguish the products or services of one business from another. Basically, any graphic representations can be used as trademarks under the law:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item words (eg. Victorinox)
	\item combinations of letters (e.g. SBB),
	\item numericals (eg. 501),
	\item graphic images (eg. the Swisscom logo),
	\item three-dimensional forms (eg. the Mercedes star),
	\item slogans (eg. “Cats would buy Whiskas”),
	\item any combination of these elements,
	\item jingles, a series of tones (acoustic trademarks, eg. the Ricola jingle)
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Purpose of trademark law}
Trademarks influence consumer decisions every day. A strong trademark creates an identity, builds trust, distinguishes from competitors, and facilitates communication between producers and consumers.
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Exclusive right:} Registering a trademark gives you the exclusive right to use a certain sign for specific goods and services.
	\item \textbf{Monetize:} You may grant someone else the right to use your trademark it through licensing.
	\item \textbf{A trademark offers protection:} As a trademark owner you can prevent others from using an identical or
	similar sign for the same or similar goods and services.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Meaning of a trademark}
The owner of a trademark work is entitled to the exclusive and sole right in the trademark to determine $\overset{1}{\text{\textbf{what} }}$ $ \overset{2}{\text{\textbf{when} }} \overset{3}{\text{\textbf{how} }}$ $\overset{4}{\text{\textbf{by whom}}}$ may be done with his or her trademark.

\subsubsection{Company name}
It is often wrongly assumed that the name of a business is automatically protected as a trademark. You should register your company name:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item in the commercial register
	\item in the trademark register
	\item with switch.ch to obtain a domain name
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Grounds for refusal of registration}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Signs which belong to the public domain must remain available to everyone and cannot be registered.
	This includes, for instance, single letters or numbers or abbreviations. A sign may also not be purely descriptive of a characteristic, quality, type or place of production (generic names). Example: «apple» cannot be registered for a type of apple or fruit but it can be registered for a computer!
	\item A trademark may also not be misleading or deceptive regarding	properties such as source or quality. Example: the trademark «GoldArt» cannot be registered for goods which are not made of gold or gilded with gold.
	\item A trademark also may be offensive to moral standards or against the law.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Colors}
As a rule, individual colors cannot be protected. Exception: colors that have come to be accepted as being distinctive and
have gained the character of a trademark through everyday use (eg. Milka).

\subsubsection{Classes of goods and services}
A trademark is not protected in general but only for those classes of goods and services for which it has been registered. When you register, you must indicate the goods and services for which you wish to register and use your trademark. \\
If you don’t use your trademark for the products (or services) you claimed within five years of registration, you can lose your trademark protection: in a litigation, the other party could claim that you do not use your trademark.

\subsubsection{Duration of trademark protection}
A trademark is protected once it is registered. The term of protection is 10 years. The 10-year term of protection can be renewed multiple times. As there is no time limit, a trademark that is actually in use can be protected indefinitely. Trademark rights are reserved for whoever registers first. A trademark must also actually be used within the five years following its registration. A trademark should remain unpublished before you apply for registration. If not, someone else can register it in their name.

\subsubsection{«Trademark registered»}
It is not compulsory to use the ® sign in Switzerland. Actually, it makes no difference if you use the ® sign or not. Using the ® sign without having actually registered the mark is an offense!

\subsubsection{International trademark protection}
Trademarks are only valid in the country where they are registered. A trademark registered in Switzerland is therefore only protected in Switzerland. If the trademark should also be protected in other countries, then you must register it there too. In most cases, even so-called regional or international registration proceedings merely result in purely national autonomous IP rights.
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Applying directly to the country concerned:} Be aware that the legal basis, filing formalities as well as examination and	granting procedures vary from country to country (costs!).
	\item \textbf{The Madrid System:} Under the Madrid System you can extend the trademark protection granted under Swiss law to other contracting states or organisations.
	\item \textbf{EU Community Trademark:} By filing one single trademark application at the Office for Harmonization in
	the Internal Market (OHIM) in Alicante, Spain, you can protect your trademark in the entire EU territory with a community trademark. Under the Madrid System, an extension to protection in the	countries of the European Union can also be applied for.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Filing a trademark}
Trademarks may be registered without any guarantee, the IGE only verifies certain formalities and prerequisites. The IGE does not verify whether identical or similar IP rights such as trademarks, company or domain names already exist. Potential conflicts with rights of other people are not examined within the registration process! \\
The owner of an earlier trademark may file opposition to a new trademark during the three months following the latter’s publication in which he can claim that there is a danger of confusion with his earlier trademark. \\
\textbf{Rules before registering:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Make sure your sign is distinctive!
	\item Search trademark registries
	\item Search commercial register and domain names!
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Opposition or Cancellation}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Opposition proceedings:} With publication on www.swissreg.ch, the three-month opposition period
	begins: owners of prior trademarks that are identical or similar to yours can file opposition to your mark during this period.	If the IGE rejects your within an opposition procedure application, you can file an appeal to the Federal Administrative Court within 30 days.
	\item \textbf{Cancellation proceedings:} For cancellation proceedings on the grounds of non-use, any person is
	allowed to request the cancellation of a trademark registration. The request for cancellation may be made at the earliest five years after expiry of the opposition period or, in the case of opposition proceedings, five years after the conclusion of opposition proceedings. The request for cancellation must be justified, in particular, by credibly
	showing non-use of the disputed trademark.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Infringements}
Protecting the market position of your trademarks is solely your responsibility.
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{At the time of registration:} Since the IGE do not officially verify the risk of confusion and thus the possibility	of conflict between trademarks, it is essential for you to monitor the market.
	\item \textbf{Anytime:} If you detect an infringement of your trademark rights, you can initiate civil or criminal proceedings in court.
\end{compactitem}
The right holder of a trademark may prohibit others from using a sign from:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item affixing the sign to goods or their packaging;
	\item offering goods, placing them on the market or stocking them for such	purposes under the sign;
	\item offering or providing services under the sign;
	\item importing, exporting or carrying in transit goods under the sign;
	\item using the sign on business papers, in advertising, or otherwise in the course	of trade.
\end{compactitem}
The following may be sanctioned by imprisonment or a fine:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item appropriates, counterfeits or imitates the trademark of the other person;
	\item places goods on the market or provides services, or offers, imports, exports, carries in transit or advertises such goods or services under the appropriated, counterfeited or imitated trademark.
	\item unlawfully labels goods or services with the trademark of another person in order to mislead and thereby give the impression that the goods or services are original goods or services;
	\item offers or places goods or services on the market as original goods or services, or offers or provides original services that unlawfully bear the trademark of another
\end{compactitem}
Whoever imports counterfeit brand products for their own personal use risks that the goods will be seized by customs.

\subsubsection{Special trademarks}
\textbf{Indication of source:}\\
Indications of source do not differentiate certain goods or services from each other by the manufacturer of the product as trademarks do, but by their geographical origin. They may only be used for products which originate from the indicated geographical area. With signs for services, the service provider must show an adequate association with the claimed geographical indication of source (eg. registered office in the country concerned).\\
\textbf{Collective mark:}\\
A collective mark identifies the products of an association of companies. Regulations specify who may use the trademark.\\
\textbf{Guarantee mark:} \\
A guarantee mark signifies that a product is guaranteed to have certain properties or qualities (e.g. quality characteristics). If the goods or services of a supplier have the guaranteed properties, the latter may use the guarantee mark as long as he or she pays the owner appropriate compensation. To avoid any conflict of interest, the trademark owner is not allowed to use the trademark himself nor have a commercial relationship with those using the trademark.

\subsection{Design}
\subsubsection{Definition design} 
In the legal sense, design is understood to be the exterior form of a product or parts of it. It can be either two-dimensional (a pattern) or three-dimensional. Its form is characterised by the arrangement of lines, contours, colours and surfaces or by the material used.

\subsubsection{Protection of designs}
Design appeals to our senses, evokes feelings, creates identity and distinguishes itself. This is why design has become one of the most crucial market factors and why counterfeiting is subsequently a frequent occurrence in this field. Owners of a design right can prevent others from using products with the same or a similar design.

\subsubsection{Filing a design}
\textbf{Criteria:} 
\begin{compactitem}
	\item The design is new , meaning no other identical or similar design has been	published before application;
	\item The design is sufficiently different from existing designs in major characteristics.
\end{compactitem}
The IGE does not examine a design for newness or distinctiveness at registration. Third parties may legally contest the design’s newness at any time by initiating court proceedings. The courts then need to decide if a protective title is valid
or not. If not, the design is canceled in the register.\\
\textbf{Period of protection:}\\
A design can be protected for a maximum of 25 years (five terms of five years each). The period of protection begins on the day of filing the application.

\subsubsection{Alternatives}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item A design may also be protected by copyright
	\item A design may be protected as a three-dimensional figurative trademark
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Patents}
\subsubsection{Purpose of patent law}
The purpose of patent law is the promotion of scientific research and innovation by granting protection to an invention for a limited period of time (i) in exchange for the disclosure of the invention, and (ii) obliging at the same time third parties to look for new solutions.
\begin{compactitem}
	\item To obtain protection by registering the invention, your application must describe your invention in such a manner that it can be carried out by a	person skilled in the art.
	\item The invention is made accessible to the public: third parties can access the knowledge and use it as a starting point for advancing their own research.
	\item Whatever is not published in the patent application is not protected.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Definition patent}
A patent is an exclusive right granted by the Swiss government for an invention in all fields of technology.\\
\textbf{Patent eligibility:}\\
An invention (in the legal sense) is a technical solution to a technical problem.\\
\textbf{Patentability:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{“Useful” = Industrial application:} The invention must be manufacturable or applicable in some commercial
	sector (including agriculture).
	\item \textbf{Novelty:} The invention must be novel. An invention is considered novel when it is not already part of the state of the art. State of the art includes anything which has been made public through writing, orally, by use, or any other means	anywhere in the world prior to the date of the patent application.
	\item \textbf{Non-obvious:} The solution to a problem is not obvious if it involves an inventive step. A solution is Obvious when a person skilled in the art would have found the the same solution by applying a minor mental effort based on the current state of	the art. Indicators of the presence of an inventive step are: a need that has not been
	met for a long time, solution that involves quite a few steps, overturning prejudices, etc.
\end{compactitem}
\textbf{Inventions include:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item products (eg. heatable ski boots, chemical compounds such as aspirin)
	\item processes (eg. a process for freeze-drying coffee)
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Protect your invention}
\textbf{Secrets:}\\
Keep your invention secret as long as you have not applied for a patent. If you make your invention public in any form before you apply for a patent, it is no longer patentable! To be patentable, an invention must be novel . An invention is novel when it has not been made available to the public anywhere in the world before the application date. If you expose your invention at an exhibit or in a scientific publication before you file your patent application, it becomes so-called "prior art" (as of “state of the art”) and is no longer considered novel when you apply for a patent. If you want to patent your invention or protect the design of your product, do not put your website online until you've filed for protection. Publishing information about your product destroys the novelty of it and makes the invention or design ineligible for protection.\\
\textbf{Strategies:}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Keep the invention secret} is the cheapest form of protection. Date the drawings and plans, put them in a sealed envelope, and then mail them to yourself (do not open the envelope!). You can also have the	documents notarized. That way, in the event a conflict arises at a later date, you will be able to prove the date of your invention (eg. the steps in your inventive process).
	\item \textbf{Protect the invention with a patent.} As a patent owner, you can commercially use your invention and prohibit others from the economic utilization of your invention (eg. producing, selling, importing) for a maximum of 20 years. This allows you to recoup the money you invested in	development and to make a profit. In return, you must accurately describe your invention and disclose it. Patent protection promotes	technological progress by allowing the state of the art of a technology to be disseminated.
	\item \textbf{Publish an invention without patenting it.} This prevents someone else from obtaining a patent for your invention -> no novelty anymore! When an invention has already been published, it is no longer considered novel and thus is not patentable.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Limitations}
The following are not considered inventions:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Ideas , concepts, discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods
	\item Rules for games , lottery systems, teaching methods and organizational flow charts
	\item Forms (these can be protected as designs or under copyrights.)
	\item Computer programs as such (these are protected by copyright). However, inventions which depend on a computer program are patentable (eg. electronic steering)
\end{compactitem}
The following are not patentable:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Diagnostic, therapies and surgery procedures used for humans or animals (however, products for use in any of these methods are patentable)
	\item Plant varieties, animal breeds, and other primarily biological procedures for breeding plants or animals (however, biotechnological inventions, such as extracting human insulin from yeast cells, are patentable)
	\item Inventions that go against public morality or law
\end{compactitem}
The human body as such, at all stages of its formation and development, including the embryo, or elements of the human body, is not patentable. However: An element of the human body is patentable as an invention if it is produced by means of a technical process, a beneficial technical effect is indicated and the further requirements as set out in Patents Act.
\textbf{USA:}\\
Many things which are not eligible as a patent in other countries can be patented in the United States of America because of a different approach: “anything under the sun made by men” can be the subject matter of a patent.

\subsubsection{Right to patent}
A patent confers on its holder the right to prohibit others from commercially using the invention. It is an absolute right and thus confers a right that can be claimed against anyone as opposed to relative rights that can be claimed against determinate persons. \\
The right to the patent can be transferred from the original inventor to another person/legal entity who then becomes the right holder.

\subsubsection{Restrictions}
A patent does not confer on its owner the right to use an invention. The patent law does not govern whether and under which conditions an invention may be used. This is the subject matter of other laws, which may provide for restrictions. For example certain products must be approved by a federal agency.

\subsubsection{Filing}
An invention must be novel and non-obvious in order for it to be protected. In Switzerland, however, the patent examination does not include novelty nor non-obviousness . This means that it is possible to have a patent granted for an invention which is not novel (eg. a patent for a record player). However, someone else may contest the novelty of your invention, and your patent could be revoked (declared invalid). \\
The material examination for a patent application usually takes place 3-4 years after the application has been filed. In the meantime, ie. 18 months after the filing date, the patent application is electronically published.

\subsubsection{Duration}
The patent right is granted by registration in the Patent register . The is no right before. The registration is then published. The protection of a patented invention lasts for a maximum of 20 years from the filing date of application. For a patent to remain valid, from the 5th year after the application, annual fees are due.

\subsubsection{Protection abroad}
There are a couple of possibilities to protect your invention abroad:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item filing directly in each country of interest,
	\item filing a European application or
	\item filing an international application (PCT).
\end{compactitem}
There is a 12-month deadline from the date of your first national patent application filing. During this period, you can file for a patent abroad and claim the date of your first application, so that novelty and non-obviousness are going to be assessed with regard to the date of first application. The priority deadline begins as of the date of filing. That means you have exactly twelve months to apply for a patent abroad claiming the filing date of the first Swiss application.

\subsubsection{Existing patent}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item If the patent is still valid in countries in which you want to conduct business, you need to negotiate with the owner on whether and how using his invention by obtaining a \textbf{license} to produce it.
	\item If the patent is already \textbf{expired}, you can use the technical information freely.
	\item You improve the product. You do not need the permission of the patent
	owner to \textbf{improve} a patented product. You can use patent protected information as a foundation from which to pursue your own research and development about it. However: It need to be checked if there are overlaps and if you must pay licensing fees.
	\item You \textbf{circumvent} the patents you found by applying other technologies and solve the problem in a different way.
	\item You \textbf{purchase} the product and save the costs of development!
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Infringement}
Don’t infringe on the rights of others. Patent, trademark, design and copyright infringements can be punished: with a monetary penalty or even, in the worst case, up to five years custodial sentence and a monetary fine.

\subsubsection{Patent pending}
Patented products or their packaging can be graphically identified, for example, by the federal cross and the patent number (+69255) and even information about the country in which the patent was granted (CH patent 69255). It is an offense to misuse these symbols. \\
To use the term “patent pending” on your invention, you must have already filed a patent application, including all relevant paperwork and all fees. Patent pending status can then be used to discourage similar patent applications from others. In this status, there is no legal protection, however most companies still see the value in using this phrase as a deterrent to those who may want to develop a similar product or rip off the invention for their own gain.

\subsubsection{Commercial use}
As soon as you have applied or filed for protection, you can sell, license (ie. 'lease’), or pledge your rights.
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Sale:} When you sell your rights, you transfer them to someone else. You can sell a patent from the start, for instance, when you don’t want to market it yourself.	This way you immediately receive the agreed upon sum, independently of the future value of the title. Or you can wait and transfer the protective right after the resulting product has been successfully marketed.
	\item \textbf{License:} Under licensing, the right owner (licensor) retains his rights. But he makes an agreement with the licensee on the manner and time period for which the protective right may be used and how the benefits will be 	managed.
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Employment}
Who owns the rights to an invention (or design) created as part of an employment relationship?
\begin{compactitem}
	\item First, check if the employment contract deals with this issue.
	\item If the employment contract does not cover this issue, then article 332 of	the Swiss Obligation Code applies: inventions (and designs) belong to the	employer if they are made in fulfillment of contractual obligations and in
	the cours of his work.
	\item Inventions (and designs) created during regular work time but not under the contractual obligations must be offered to the employer. Then the employer can decide whether he wants to obtain the invention (or design) in question.
\end{compactitem}
